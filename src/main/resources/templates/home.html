<!-- Base Template (base.html)
This is the layout template that contains the overall structure of the web page. It includes things like the HTML structure, external CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript files. It also defines a fragment for content insertion.

th:fragment="layout(content)": This defines a fragment called layout in the base.html template. The content part is a placeholder where dynamic content (from other pages) will be inserted.

<div th:replace="${content}"></div>: This is where dynamic content will be placed. The value of content is passed from another page (like home.html). The th:replace directive replaces this div with the content from the other page.

<title th:text="${title}">Hello, world!</title>: This sets the title of the page dynamically. The value of ${title} will be provided from the controller or page using this layout. If no value is provided, the default text Hello, world! will be used.

2. Home Page (home.html)
This is a child page that uses the base.html layout. It contains the specific content for the home page.

th:insert="base::layout(~{::section})": This tells Thymeleaf to use the base.html layout and insert the content of the home.html page into the content section of base.html. It inserts the content defined within the <section> tag of the home.html.

<section>: The actual content that will be inserted into the base.html layout. Here, it contains two <h1> tags, one that says "this is home Page" and the other that says "Hello Vaibhav."

Key Thymeleaf Concepts in Use:
Fragments: Reusable pieces of templates that can be included in other templates. In this case, the base.html defines a layout fragment, and home.html inserts its content into that fragment.

Dynamic Content: The ${title} and ${content} variables are placeholders that will be replaced by dynamic values when the page is rendered.

th:replace and th:insert: These are used to replace or insert content dynamically. The content from home.html is inserted into base.html at the location of the th:replace tag.

Flow of Execution:
The server renders home.html.
home.html uses base.html as a layout (through th:insert).
The content inside the <section> tag of home.html is inserted into the <div th:replace="${content}"> placeholder in base.html.
The final HTML output is a combination of the base layout and the home page content, resulting in a complete web page. -->
